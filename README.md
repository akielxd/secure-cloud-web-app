**Overview**

This project involves the development and deployment of a secure, custom web application originally created on Microsoft Azure and now deployed using Cloudflare for enhanced performance and security. The application was designed with business clients in mind, offering a scalable and secure solution to meet high security standards, while benefiting from Cloudflare’s global content delivery network (CDN) and security features.

**Key Features**
* **Custom Web Application**: A secure, containerized application tailored for business client needs.
* **Deployed on Cloudflare**: The app is now hosted and served via Cloudflare, improving performance with their CDN and security features.
* **Containerized Environments**: The application runs in a containerized setup, ensuring portability and consistency.
* **SSL Certificates**: Configured SSL certificates to secure all user data and ensure HTTPS traffic.
* **Cloudflare Security Services**: Leveraged Cloudflare’s Web Application Firewall (WAF), DDoS protection, and other security features.
* **Domain Mapping**: Managed domain mapping for smooth traffic routing.
* **Continuous Monitoring**: Integrated with Cloudflare’s security features, offering real-time traffic monitoring and insights.

**Security Features**
* **SSL Certificates**: Configured to enable secure HTTPS communication.
* **Cloudflare WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Rules to protect against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and more.
* **Cloudflare DDoS Protection**: Leverage Cloudflare’s advanced DDoS protection to ensure service availability and minimize risks.
* **Security Monitoring**: Cloudflare provides continuous monitoring and security analytics to help identify and mitigate threats in real time.

**Infrastructure**
* **Microsoft Azure (initial deployment)**: Initially developed and deployed on Azure using Azure Container Instances (ACI) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
* **Moved to Cloudflare**: After the app was migrated to Cloudflare, it now benefits from their fast CDN, security features, and simplified management.
* **Containerized Environments**: Docker containers were used to package the application, ensuring consistent and efficient deployment in different environments.

**Deployment**
1. Build the Docker Container:
* Ensure all necessary files for the containerized application are in place.
* Use Docker to package your app and deploy it on your server or Cloudflare’s infrastructure.

2. Set up Cloudflare:
* Point your domain to Cloudflare by changing your DNS records to use Cloudflare’s nameservers.
* Enable Cloudflare's CDN and security features for optimal performance and protection.
* Configure Cloudflare's SSL settings for HTTPS traffic.

3. Secure the Application:
* **WAF Rules**: Set up Cloudflare WAF to block malicious traffic.
* **DDoS Protection**: Enable DDoS protection on Cloudflare to protect your app from volumetric attacks.

4. Continuous Monitoring:
* Monitor traffic and performance via Cloudflare’s dashboard, which provides real-time insights and recommendations.

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
cd your-repo

3. Build and run the Docker container (if applicable):
   
docker build -t your-app .
docker run -d -p 80:80 your-app

5. Deploy the container on Cloudflare:
* Use Cloudflare’s tools to deploy and manage your application, or host it on your server and route traffic through Cloudflare.

**Usage**
* Access the web application via the domain you have configured in Cloudflare.
* Enjoy the benefits of faster load times, improved security, and reliable performance through Cloudflare’s global network.
